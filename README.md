Rainfall-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-A-Comparative-Analysis-of-Classifier-Performance

It is a Python project that predicts rainfall categories using weather features like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Three classifiers—Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and SVM—are compared, with XGBoost performing best. The full ML pipeline is detailed in this repository.
